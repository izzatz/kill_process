# Python - Kill Windows Process
List all running process and let the user kill specific listed process by entering the PID.

This is a script which I created to speed up my process to kill an active java.exe instances. My use case would be, at anytime I launch a SAP PO Netweaver, I need to skim through a running process from Windows Task Manager. I need to find an adoptopenjdk (java.exe) process. Usually there will be 2 instances and I need to kill the one with smaller RAM usage. 

With this small dashboard, it will be much easier to narrow down the process and just kills what is necessary.
