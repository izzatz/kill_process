# kill_process
List all running process and let the user kill specific listed process by entering the PID.

This is a script which I created to speed up my process to kill an active java.exe instances. My use case would be, at anytime I launch a SAP PO Netweaver, I need to skim through a running process from Windows Task Manager. I need to find a adoptopenjdk (java.exe) process and kill the smaller size. 

With this small dashboard, it will be much easier to narrow down the process and just kills what is necessary.
